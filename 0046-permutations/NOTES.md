permutation
1)recursive call is made to 1 first it is added in the stack marked visited then the next call will be made till size of vector is less than nums vector
â€‹
2) now when the size of ans is equal to  nums vector we will return
3) then while backtracking we will make freq back to 0 and pop from ans vector
